Package for extracting entity information from text documents using [MITIE](https://github.com/mit-nlp/MITIE) and storing it as an edgelist.

Some functions here are taken directly from the [`openNLP`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openNLP/index.html) package. This was done, rather than using that package as a DEPENDS, becaue [`openNLP`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/openNLP/index.html) depends on [`rJava`](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rJava/index.html), a requirement we aim to avoid.
